# Simple api to connect the front-end and the database, using NodeJs and Express on the back-end, and MySql database.

To use you just have to clone it and run:

**npm i** => to install all the dependencies

**nodemon index** => This commmand will create the database named *'hoteldatabase'*, create the tables and add 3 registers just to test if its working fine. You can delete it afterwards.
